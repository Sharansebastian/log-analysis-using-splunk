# log-analysis-using-splunk
This project focuses on performing log analysis in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using Splunk.The project collects machine-generated log data and imports it into Splunk for centralized monitoring and analysis. Logs are normalized and correlated to detect unusual or malicious activities.
SSH Log Analysis

Project Objectives:
   Monitor and analyze SSH authentication logs,
   Detect successful and failed login attempts,
   Identify brute-force and password-spraying attacks,
   Analyze HTTP traffic to detect suspicious web activity,
   Create dashboards, alerts, and visualizations for security monitoring.

The project analyzes Secure Shell (SSH) logs to:
   Track successful user logins,
   Detect repeated failed login attempts,
   Identify brute-force attacks,
   Monitor suspicious connections without authentication,
   HTTP Log Analysis.

Web server logs are analyzed to detect:
   High traffic from suspicious IP addresses,
   Server errors and abnormal responses,
   Scripted or automated attacks,
   Unauthorized access to sensitive URLs,
   Large or unusual file transfers.
   
Alerting and Visualization:
   The project uses dashboards and real-time alerts to help security analysts quickly identify and respond to threats.

Security Measures Demonstrated:
   The project also suggests mitigation techniques such as:
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
      Account lockout policies,
      IP blocking and filtering,
      Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules,
      Continuous monitoring and incident response.
